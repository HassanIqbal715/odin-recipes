# odin-recipes
This repository contains the 1st project of The Odin Project called odin-recipes. 

This is just a basic HTML project that will consist of an index webpage that will link to a recipe webpage.

So far I have learned about:
-> The main HTML layout
-> Paragraphs, Headings, and strong and emphasised words
-> Ordered and Unordered lists
-> Links and Images

Which will be utilized in this project.
